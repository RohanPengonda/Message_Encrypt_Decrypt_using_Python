**About**

**ENCRYPTION**
Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext).
Encryption provide us high security and privacy on our chat/ messages ,or in sharing any confidential data on any social media .
if I want to send your bank no. password or any other legal pin or code, we can't trust on any messenger. But what happened if we encrypt this messages. Then no one can read this , even can't understand.

**DECRYPTION**
Decryption is a process of converting encrypted text back to normal text.
So the people have this software and password, can ready it easily.
Feel safe and secure with any messages ,keep privacy.

**Tools_Used:**

1. TKinter:-
   It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.Python Tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications.Creating a GUI using Tkinter is an easy task.
2. Base64:-
   Base64 is a method for encoding binary data (such as images and binary files) into ASCII characters which are more easily manipulated and stored in text formats.
   Base64 encoding is commonly used in data transport, email encryption, and web applications to transfer binary data safely over channels that only reliably support text content.
   In Python, the base64 module provides functionalities for encoding and decoding Base64.
